		<h3>Section 1: Getting started</h3>
		<br /> 
		Getting started with OTC is very simple and easy with just 4 main stages. There are a couple of activities to be 
		done on your DEV environment to implement, unit test and integrate OTC, but only one of those activities on all 
		other environments from QA to the PROD.  
		<br />
		<br />
		There are <b><i>"Try it out:"</i></b> sub-sections given for practice under various sections as you proceed through 
		this document. I would recommend you to do it without fail so that it becomes easy for you to flow along.
		<br />
		<br /> 
		This section gives a high level view of the the steps involved in implementing OTC. The details are 
		elaborated as we proceed. Very briefly at a high level, below are the activities you do - 
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<h4>Stage 1: Setup and build the OTC script file (on DEV environment only)</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Get the <i><b>"otc.zip"</b></i> file. (one time)</li>
			<li>Setup <i><b>"OTC_HOME"</b></i> environment variable. (one time)</li>
			<li>Start the <i><b>"otceditor.jar"</b></i> web-application.</li>
			<li>Start the OTC Script editor UI on the browser.</li>
			<li>Create all required OTCS command blocks using the UI.</li>
			<li>Save the OTC script file.</li>
		</ol>
		<br />

		<h4>Stage 2: Unit testing (DEV environment)</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Import and setup the <i><b>"OTC-test"</b></i> Maven project in your IDE. (one time)</li>
			<li>Compile the OTCS file.</li>
			<li>Execute the generated code.</li>
		</ol>
		<br />

		<h4>Stage 3: Integration (DEV environment)</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Copy the <i><b>"*.java"</b></i> files generated in the above step into your project.</li>
			<li>If the integration environment is different from the one used in the above step, then copy the 
				<i><b>"*.tmd"</b></i> files generated during testing to the target environment.
			</li>
			<li>Add the dependencies to the OTC executor module in your project. 
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li>Invoke OTC's Executor.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<br/>
		<h4>Stage 4: Promote to QA / Production</h4>
		Since you would have already unit-tested, integrated and packaged the generated code and the OTC-Executor invocation 
		in your application, there is only one step to be done at this stage and that is to copy the <b>"*.tmd"</b> files to 
		the below folder on the target environments. 
		<br />
		<br />
		<i><b>"${OTC_HOME}/tmd"</b></i>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h4>Detailed steps</h4>
		<br/>
		Now lets go into the details on some of the points mentioned above -
		<br/>
		<ol>
			<li><h5>Setting-up OTC_HOME: </h5>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>Download the <b><i>"otc.zip"</b></i> file and extract it. You will find 3 folders and a web-app as shown 
						below.
						<br/>
						<img alt="OTC Home folder" class="otcImage" src="./images/doc-otc-home-folder.png" width="150" 
							height="100" />
					</li>
					<li>Copy the <b><i>"otc-home"</b></i> folder to a desired location in your hard-drive.</li>
					<li>Setup the <b><i>"OTC_HOME"</b></i> environment variable pointing to the <b><i>"otc-home"</b></i> 
						folder.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Start the OTC Script Editor UI:</h5>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>After extracting the <b><i>"otc.zip"</i></b> file, open a terminal window and CD into the directory 
						containing the file <b><i>"otceditor.jar"</i></b></li>
					<li>Start the <b><i>"otceditor.jar"</i></b> by typing</li>
					<pre><b><i>java -jar otceditor.jar</i></b></pre>
					<li>Wait for a few seconds for the OTCS editor startup to complete.</li>
					<li>Open your favorite browser and enter
					<pre><b><i>http://localhost:1674</i></b></pre>
					You should see the OTCS Editor UI on the browser and we are all set and ready to go ahead with creating 
					the OTCS files. The next section on the <b>"OTCS Editor"</b> provides you with more details on this.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Unit-testing:</h5>
				The OTCS file you create has to be tested. There are several test-cases provided in the download. Do the below to setup your environment for unit-testing -
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The downloaded file has a Maven project for unit-testing purposes. After you create the OTCS files for your 
				project, you should first run the <b><i>"org.otcframework.test.unit.OtcTest"</i></b> in this test project which 
				will trigger the OTC-compiler to generate all the object conversion source-code and also execute them and 
				display the results. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				But to execute the generated object conversion source-code you also need to provide a source object loaded with 
				values. For the test-cases which are accompanied in the download, XML files are provided with data from which 
				the source object is created and populated. The test-cases in <b>"${OTC_HOME}/pretest"</b> folder refers to 
				types present in the <b>"otc-test-schema"</b> project.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				But your case may be different. In such a case you may update the code in <b>OtcTest.java</b> file to change 
				the way you want to create and populate the source object.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Once you are satisfied with the unit testing results, then you may integrate the files generated by the 
				OTC-Compiler into your main software project.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Now let us setup these projects -
				<br/>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>After extracting the downloaded file, you will find 2 Maven projects by name <b><i>"otc-test"</i></b>
					 	with a few test-classes and the <b><i>"otc-test-schema"</i></b> with all the DTOs used in these 
					 	sections.
					 </li>
					<li>Import both the <b><i>"otc-test"</i></b> and the <b><i>"otc-test-schema"</i></b> projects into your IDE 
						and build them.
						<br/>
						The <b><i>"otc-test"</i></b> project has a dependency on the <b><i>"otc-test-schema"</i></b> project.
					</li>
					<li>The <b><i>"otc-test"</i></b> project has a few test classes. There are a couple of JMH test classes and 
						a Junit test class. A detailed explanation on the Junit test class is covered in the section titled 
						<b><i>"Test Project"</i></b>.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<br/>
				You should review the code of the Junit test class to familiarize yourself with the steps.
				<br/>
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Integration:</h5>
				Next you have to integrate the generated code and the TMD files into your software project. Below are the 
				integration steps:
				<br/>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>Add the OTC binary dependencies in your project.</li>
		    		<li>Please check for the latest version of the binaries on Maven central repository and specify that in 
		    			your dependency script.</li>
					<li>And then copy the generated <b><i>"*.java"</i></b> files into the right package in your project's 
						source code folder in your IDE.</li>
					<li>If your software development environment is different from the environment where the OTCS files were 
						unit-tested, then you have to copy the <b><i>"*.tmd"</i></b> files from <b><i>"${OTC_HOME}/bin"</i></b> 
						folder on the OTCS tested environment to the same path on the new environment.</li>
					<li>While promoting to the QA and the PROD environments, only the <b><i>"*.tmd"</i></b> files has to be 
						copied as you would have already integrated the generated source code files and packaged it.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
		<h4>Try it out:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Download the <b><i>"otc.zip"</b></i> file by clicking on the <b><i>"Binaries..."</b></i> link on the left menu 
			at the top of this page and enter the required details.</li>
			<li>Extract the downloaded file and copy the <b><i>"otc-home"</b></i> folder to a desired location.</li>
			<li>Setup the <b><i>"OTC_HOME"</b></i> environment variable pointing to this folder.</li>
			<li>Copy the <b><i>"otc-test"</i></b> and the <b><i>"otc-test-schema"</i></b> projects to a desired location.</li>
			<li>Start your favorite IDE.</li>
			<li>Import both <b><i>"otc-test"</i></b> and the <b><i>"otc-test-schema"</i></b> projects into your IDE 
			and build them.</li>
			<li>Start the editor: First copy the <b><i>"otceditor.jar"</i></b> to a desired location.</li>
			<li>Start the terminal window and <b><i>"cd"</i></b> into the directory where you have copied this file.</li>
			<li>Type <b><i>java -jar otceditor.jar</i></b> and press ENTER.</li>
			<li>Start your browser and type <b><i>http://localhost:1674</i></b></li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
		<h4>Terminologies:</h4>
		<br/>
		Going forward it is required to be familiar with some of the terminologies used. Below is a short list:
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>OTC and OTCS:</b> OTC is the acronym of <b><i>Object Tree Converter</i></b>, and OTCS is the acronym 
				of <b><i>Object Tree Conversion Script</i></b>. 
			    <br/>
			</li>
			<li><b>The OTC object-path (aka OTC-Chain):</b> OTCS-object-path is the representation of a path in an 
				object-tree beginning from a child-node directly under the root-class all the way to a leaf-node. 
				The object-path consists of all the field-names in the object-path with some additional characters and 
				notations delimited by dots. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Below is an example:
				<br/>
				<pre><b><i>travelers.traveler[*].pnrs[*,*]&lt;V&gt;.name.given[*].value</i></b></pre>
				<br/>
				Here we see that the chain beginning with <b><i>"travelers"</i></b>, is one of the children of the root-class -
				you may want to look up the source code of <b><i>"AthenaAirlinePassenger"</i></b>. You can notice that this is 
				followed by the different field-names in the path all the way up to the leaf-node named <b><i>"value"</i></b>.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<i><u><b>Note:</b> An OTC-object-path will always have a pair, wherein the other part will be either another 
				OTC-object-path or a list of values.</u></i>
		    	<br/>
		    	<br/>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>OTC-tokens:</b> All the text between the dots in an OTC-object-path are called OTC-tokens. These tokens 
				represent the field-names defined in the class. Additionally few specific notations are used in certain 
				scenarios along with the field-names to represent collections. 
		    	<br/>
		    	<br/>
				Below are the details -
				<ol type="a">
					<li><u>List notation:</u> When a token is suffixed with a list notation which is 
						<b><i>"[*]"</i></b> as seen in <b><i>".traveler[*]."</i></b> in the above example, then such a 
						field is either an - 
						<ol type="i">
							<li>Array, or a</li>
							<li>List, or a </li>
							<li>Set.</li>
						</ol>
				    	<br/>
					</li>
					<li><u>Dictionary notation:</u> A <b><i>"[*,*]"</i></b> notation suffix represents a dictionary (map). 
						But since each entry in a dictionary has a key and a value pair, they are denoted differently as 
						explained below.
				    	<br/>
				    	<br/>
					</li>
					<li><u>Dictionary key notation:</u>  To reference a key in the dictionary, a <b><i>"&lt;K&gt;"</i></b> 
						notation is used as a suffix to the dictionary-notation as in <b><i>"[*,*]&lt;K&gt;"</i></b>. 
				    	<br/>
				    	<br/>
					</li>
					<li><u>Dictionary value notation:</u> To reference a value in the dictionary, a <b><i>"&lt;V&gt;"</i></b> 
						notation is used as a suffix to the dictionary-notation as in <b><i>"[*,*]&lt;V&gt;"</i></b>. In the 
						OTC-object-path example given above we notice that it has a dictionary-value notation as seen in 
						<b><i>".pnrs[*,*]&lt;V&gt;."</i></b>.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<br/>
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Token-path:</b> A token-path is a subset of the OTC-object-path beginning from the 1st token. Its a 
				path to a specific OTC-token in the OTC-object-path. A token-path in an OTCS file is identified by the 
				property name <b><i>"tokenPath:"</i></b> which is covered under another section.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<i><b>Note:</b> A token-path could even be the entire OTC-object-path depending on need; more on 
				this in a later section.</u></i>
			</li>
