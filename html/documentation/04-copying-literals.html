		<h3>Section 4: Copying literals</h3>
		In this section, we will learn OTCS's "copy" command. 
		<br/>  
		<br/>  
		There are 2 variants of OTCS's copy command.
		<ul>
			<li>Copying literals (values)</li>
			<li>Copying from source object</li>
		</ul>
		We will focus on the 1st version of the copy command by providing only values, i.e, without using a source-object.
		<br/>  
		<ol>
			<li><h4>Example of the Copy-literals command:</h4>
			We will start with an example of the <b>"copy:"</b> command to create an object by directly providing values. 
			To create such an object, the <b>"from:"</b> parameter should have the <b>"values:"</b> property as shown here - 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<i>Test case: <b>"${OTC_HOME}/pretest/cpyvalues1"</b>.</i>
			<br/>
			<pre>otcsCommands:
- copy:
    id: CP1
    from:
      values:
      - Elon Musk
    to:
      objectPath: travelerDetailType.name.surname.value
    factoryClassName: CP1</pre> 
    		<br/>
			This is an example with the minimum set of parameters for the copy command.
			<br/> 
			<br/> 
			The <b>"values:"</b> property is an array and so allows you to specify a list of values. The <b>"to:"</b> 
			parameter has the <b>"objectPath:"</b> property and the compiler generates code to create all the objects 
			in the object-path after null checks for each child in the path. 
			<br/> 
			<br/> 
			Here is the output in XML of the object that was created by this example. 
			<br/> 
			<br/> 
			<img alt="OTCS script copy command to copy literal values" class="otcImage" 
				src="./images/doc-CopyValues-flat-ex.png" width="300" height="170" />
			<br/> 
			<br/> 
			Please note that in the above example, you do not notice the leaf-node field name <b>"value"</b>. That has got 
			nothing to do with OTC but with the XML marshaller which do not marshal the field name in the output when 
			certain field-names are annotated with specific JAXB annotations. However if you produce a JSON output instead, 
			you will see the fieldname <b>"value"</b> as well produced by the JSON marshaller.
			<br/> 
			<br/> 
		</li>
		<li><h4>Copying literals to list / set types:</h4>
			<i>Test case: <b>"${OTC_HOME}/pretest/cpyvalues2"</b>.</i>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Here is an example OTCS fragment of copying values to object-paths containing collections.
			<br/>
			<pre>- copy:
    id: CP1
    from:
      values:
      - Economy
      - Business
    to:
      objectPath: dataLists.passengerList.passenger[*].identityDocuments[*].visa.visaType
    factoryClassName: CP1</pre>
			<br/>
			The OTCS object-path in this example consists of collection-type OTCS tokens indicating the target object-path 
			contains collection-types. When the OTCS-Compiler encounters the 3rd and 4th level tokens <b>"passenger[*]"</b> 
			and <b>"identityDocuments[*]"</b> during code generation, it creates ArrayList's as they are of 
			<b>java.util.List</b> interface type in the source-code of the DTO class. In the resulting target object 
			created by this copy command which is shown below in XML output, you can notice that there are 2 members in the 
			<b>"identityDocuments[*]"</b> collection due to the fact that two values were provided in the <b>"values:"</b> 
			property.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<img alt="OTCS script copy command to add members in collections" class="otcImage" 
				src="./images/doc-CopyValues-list-ex.png" width="350" height="250" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Below is a list of default concrete types for 4 of the collection-type interfaces.
			<ol type="a">
				<li>java.util.List defaults to java.util.ArrayList</li>
				<li>java.util.Set defaults to java.util.HashSet</li>
				<li>java.util.Queue defaults to java.util.LinkedList</li>
				<li>java.util.Map defaults to java.util.HashMap</li>
			</ol> 
			<br/>
			This can however be overridden with your preferences which is covered in another section titled 
			<b>"Overrides"</b>.
			<br/>
			<br/>  
		</li>
		<li><h4>Copying literals to Dictionaries (Maps):</h4>
			Next, we shall see how to add entries into a map. This has to be done in 2 steps following a specific order 
			since a map-entry has a key and a value. A map value cannot be added without a key. So it is required to add a 
			map-key as a first step and then add the map-value any time later.  
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<i>Test case for both Step 1 and Step 2 given below: <b>"${OTC_HOME}/pretest/cpyvalues3"</b>.</i>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<h5>Step-1: Inserting map-keys</h5>
			Here is an example of the OTCS command-block for the first step of adding a key into a map.
			<pre>- copy:
    id: CP1
    from:
      values:
      - F31
      - F32
    to:
      objectPath: travelers.traveler[*].anonymousTravelerMap[*,*]&lt;K&gt;</pre>
			<br/>
			This example is something similar to the one we already saw earlier except that it has a map-key notation in the 
			OTCS-object-path. You can notice that there are 2 collections in this OTCS-object-path. In the map-key notation 
			<b>"anonymousTravelerMap[*,*]&lt;K&gt;"</b>, the reference is made to the map-key with the suffix 
			<b>"&lt;K&gt;"</b>. The map-key is a scalar type i.e. String and this command creates 2 map entries with the keys 
			<b>"F31"</b> and <b>"F32"</b> passed in the <b>"values:"</b> property. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<h5>Step-2: Inserting map-values</h5>
			Here is an example OTCS command of the 2nd step of adding a value into a map.
			<pre>- copy:
    id: CP1
    from:
      values:
      - Pondy Prem
      - Rajesh S
    to:
      objectPath: travelers.traveler[*].anonymousTravelerMap[*,*]&lt;V&gt;.given[*].value</pre>
			<br/>
			In this 2nd step example, there are 2 values to be added as map values. In the token 
			<b>"anonymousTravelerMap[*,*]&lt;V&gt;"</b>, the reference is made to the map-value with the suffix 
			<b>"&lt;V&gt;"</b>. Looking at the source-code of this DTO class in the schema project, you will find that the 
			map-value is a composite-type having a child object by the name <b>"given"</b> which is of a collection type. 
			The members of this collection-type are also composite-type <b>"TravelerSummaryType.Name.Given"</b>. The member 
			has a leaf-node by name <b>"value"</b>, which is of the scalar type and to which the values are set. Since there 
			are two values, the collection represented by the token <b>"given[*]"</b> will have 2 entries as its members.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			If in case you are wondering how the integrity of the order is ensured, not to worry. It is taken care of by 
			OTC's Indexer component.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Here is the output of the object that was created with this OTCS command. 
			<br/>
			<img alt="OTCS script copy command to add key n value into maps" class="otcImage" 
				src="./images/doc-CopyValues-map-ex.png" width="300" height="100" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			But, you will notice an issue between both the maps in the results - the values have not gone to the right place.
			This issue is because the count of collection-type tokens in the source and target object-paths we have provided
			do not match. But OTCS has a very easy, simple and a very unique feature called Anchors to induce a flexible 
			behavior. We will solve it in one of the following sections.
			<br/>
			<br/>
		</li>
		<li><h4>Copying values to Enum fields:</h4>
			Next, we will see how to set values to the enum fields.  The method <b>"valueOf(..)"</b> provided by default in 
			Java on all enum-types is called in the generated code which expects the enum-name as a string parameter. So, 
			the correct enum-name has to be provided to this valueOf(...) method. Here is an example code of an enum-type -  
			<br/>
			<pre>public enum TravelerGenderSimpleType {

    MALE("Male"),
    FEMALE("Female"),
    OTHER("Other");
    
    private final String value;

    TravelerGenderSimpleType(String v) {
        value = v;
    }
}</pre>
			In this example code, the enum names are "MALE", "FEMALE" and "OTHER" all of them in upper-case (not the values
			given within parenthesis). As per this example, the value provided in the OTCS-command-block should match the 
			name. Any value provided differently in contrast to the entire name in upper-case for this enum-type is not 
			valid and will fail during execution even though the code generation and compilation will succeed without any 
			issues. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Here is the example OTCS command for populating enum fields.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<i>Test case: <b>"${OTC_HOME}/pretest/cpyvalues4"</b>.</i>
			<br/>
			<pre>- copy:
    id: CP1
    from:
      values:
      - MALE
    to:
      objectPath: travelerDetailType.gender.value</pre>
			<br/>		
			And below is the output in XML of the object that was created -
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<img alt="OTCS script copy command to create enums" class="otcImage" 
				src="./images/doc-CopyValues-enum-ex.png" width="250" height="100" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
		</li>
		<li><h4>Copying literals to Date fields:</h4>
			Copying values to Date fields is very much simplified - I created another utility called date-converter to 
			simplify this and made it available on Maven central. The next section is about this utility where the details 
			are covered.
			<br/>		
			<br/>		
			The date-type of the target leaf-token could be of any of the APIs mentioned here. 
			<br/>		
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Old-school JDK date API</li>
				<li>Java8 time API</li>
				<li>Joda date API.</li>
				<li>Date String</li>
			</ol>		
			<br/>		
			But here in this section, we will see how to set a date-field by providing a date string. And in another section 
			covering the 2nd variant of the copy command, we will see how to convert a date object to another. Below is an 
			example of the OTCS fragment to create objects with date fields -
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<i>Test case: <b>"${OTC_HOME}/pretest/cpyvalues5"</b>.</i>
			<br/>
			<pre>- copy:
    id: CP1
    from:
      values:
      - 12-Dec-05
      - 25-02-2006
    to:
      objectPath: travelers.traveler[*].customObjectsMap[*,*]&lt;K&gt;.age.birthDate.value</pre>
      
			<br/>
			So here the <b>"values:"</b> parameter has 2 date-strings with each of them having different date-formats.
			<br/> 
			<br/> 
			Interestingly you may notice that no date-format string is specified as usually done while converting 
			date-strings to date-types in Java. And that's because, it is taken care of by the date-converter utility.
			<br/> 
			<br/> 
			And below is the output in XML of the object that was created by this OTCS-command-block.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<img alt="OTCS script copy command to create date fields" class="otcImage" 
				src="./images/doc-CopyValues-date-ex.png" width="350" height="100" />
		</li>
		</ol>
		<h4><b><u>Try it out:</u></b></h4>
		Now lets try-out what we just learnt.
		<br/>
		<ol>
			<li>First let us take a look at the OTC script file which we want to execute.</li>
			<li>Open the file <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-pretest/com.athena.airlines.dto.AthenaAirlinePassenger.otcs"</b> in any 
				text editor.</li>
			<li>Notice the <b>"metadata:"</b> section and the <b>"otcsCommands:"</b> section.</li>
			<li>The first two copy commands <b>"CPY1"</b> and <b>"CPY2"</b> copies values to flat-object-paths i.e. no 
				collections in the object-path.</li>
			<li>This 3rd command <b>"CPY3"</b> is an example of a single collection in the OTCS-object-path.</li>
			<li>The next command <b>"CPY4"</b> is an example of 2 collections in the path.</li>
			<li>The next set of two commands <b>"CPY5"</b> and <b>"CPY6"</b> are to create a map-entry with a key and a 
				value.</li>
			<li>The next command <b>"CPY7"</b> is an example to copy values into Enum fields.</li>
			<li>And finally, <b>"CPY8"</b> is an example to copy values into date fields.</li>
			<li>Now lets run the Junit-test class to execute the script file we just did a walk-through.</li>
			<li>Copy this file from <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-pretest/"</b> to <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-unittest/"</b> folder.</li>
			<li>In the <b>"org.otcframework.test.unit.OtcTest.java"</b> test-class, set the variable value for 
				"otcsCommandType" as <b>"otcsCommandType = OTCS_COMMAND_TYPE.FROM_VALUES;"</b></li>
			<li>Set the value of variable "pkg" to <b>"pkg = null;"</b>.</li>
			<li>Now run the Junit test-class.</li>
			<li>From the console logs we can see that the script is compiled and the source code is generated and compiled.
			</li>
			<li>The test class will do all what we already learnt earlier and print the output in XML format.</li>
			<li>In the XML output we can see the map with 2 entries. But you will see that the values are not copied into 
				the right location.  As already mentioned we will solve this in another section.</li>
			<li>In the XML output, we can see the values are copied to the date fields.</li>
			<li>In the last part of the output, we see how a Enum field is populated with the right value.</li>
		</ol>
