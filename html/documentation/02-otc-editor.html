		<h3>Section 2: OTC Script Editor</h3>
			In the previous section on "Getting Started" we went through the process of downloading and starting the 
			OTC-Editor web application to help in creating the OTC script files. In this section, we will learn how to use 
			the editor and create those files. The OTC-editor is a tool for use by software developers who wants to generate 
			the OTC script files without having to manually type them out. All the developer has to do is just 
			click-click-click - its that easy.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			The UI has 2 vertical sections – one for the
			"source" object on the left also called as the "from" and the other for the "target" object on the right 
			also called as the "to". In each section, the developer has to make a few selections and add the entire OTCS 
			command block on a single click.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Below is a screen-shot of the editor:
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<img alt="OTC script editor" src="./images/doc-otc-editor.png" width="900" height="600" />
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Now lets go through each of the components on this editor screen.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Pkg/NS:</b> On the top in both sections are text boxes labeled <b>"Pkg/NS"</b> which denotes 
					<b>"Package / Namespace name"</b>. Enter the package names of your root classes on both sides for which 
					you want to create the OTCS command blocks. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<i><b><u>Note:</u></b> If the OTCS file which you are going to create will not contain <b>"objectPath:"</b> 
					property in the <b>"from:"</b> parameter in the entire OTCS file but only <b>"values:"</b> property, 
					then there is no need to enter the source package name and select a source-type. (see the OTC script 
					example given below)</i>
					<br/>
					<br/>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Fetch Types:</b> When you click on the <b>"Fetch-types"</b> button, the application will retrieve all 
					the class names in that specified package and will populate the <b>"Types"</b> drop-down.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				</li>
					
				<li><b>Types:</b> Select the root class from the <b>"Types"</b> drop down for both the "from" and the 
					<b>"to"</b>.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				</li>
								
				<li><b>OTC script area:</b> Just below the user-input elements what we have is the <b>"OTC-script-area"</b>
					which is where the OTCS-command-blocks are added. The next section provides details of the OTCS blocks. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>Pop-up Menu:</b> Right-clicking on this area will display a pop-up menu with the command options 
					<b>"copy"</b> and <b>"execute"</b>" to choose from.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Actions panel:</b> Just below this is the horizontally laid-out <b>"Actions panel"</b> with a few 
					buttons to perform various operations.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>"Show Tree" button:</b> This button when clicked will display the tree structure of both the source 
					and the target classes in the bottom <b>"Tree-area"</b> section.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>"Add OTCS Command" button:</b> The <b>"Add OTCS Command"</b> button when clicked after selecting the 
					appropriate fields in the tree-structures will generate the OTCS-command-block in the <b>"OTCS-area"</b>.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The generated OTCS contents will contain some place-holders for specific parameters expected to be 
					filled in by the developer. The place-holders are the text enclosed within "&lt;&lt;" and "&gt;&gt;" 
					angular brackets. If they are not applicable then such parameter's entire lines has to be removed. The 
					place-holders are - <b>&lt;&lt;helperClassName&gt;&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;&lt;namespace&gt;&gt;</b> 
					<b>&lt;&lt;converter&gt;&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;&lt;module&gt;&gt;</b>
					<br/>
					<br/>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>"Create file" button:</b> Clicking on the <b>"Create file"</b> button will present you a download 
					dialog box to save it as a <b>".otcs"</b> file. The location you should select for saving the file 
					should be the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-pretest"</b> folder. While running the OTCS compiler, in order to have 
					the generated code placed under a package (namespace) hierarchy, create a folder structure to represent 
					the package hierarchy. And when you want to unit-test the OTCS file, copy the file / folder containing 
					the file which you want to unit-test to the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-unittest"</b> folder.			
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<i><u><b>Note:</b></u></i> DO NOT change the name of the file if you are prompted to select a location to 
				save the file or after downloading. It is important to keep the name determined by OTCS editor intact for the 
				OTCS's compiler to identify the types.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Below is an example of an OTCS script contents -
				<pre>metadata:
  objectTypes:
    source: com.kronos.airlines.dto.KronosAirlinePassenger
    target: com.athena.airlines.dto.AthenaAirlinePassenger
  entryClassName: KronosToAthena
commands:
- copy:
    id: CV01
    from:
      values:
      - Elon Musk
    to:
      objectPath: mainPassengerName
#    disable: true
- copy:
    id: MP11
    from:
      objectPath: travelerDetailType.name.surname.value
    to:
      objectPath: dataLists.passengerList.passenger[*].identityDocuments[*].visa.visaType
    factoryClassName: MP11
#    disable: true
- copy:
    id: OV05
    from:
      objectPath: travelers.traveler[*].recognizedTravelerMap[*,*]&lt;V&gt;.gender.value.value
      overrides:
      - tokenPath: travelers.traveler[*].recognizedTravelerMap[*,*]&lt;V&gt;.gender.value.value
        getter: value
    to:
      objectPath: travelers.traveler[*].anonymousTravelerMap[*,*]&lt;V&gt;.gender.value
      overrides:
      - tokenPath: travelers.traveler[*].anonymousTravelerMap[*,*]
        concreteType: java.util.LinkedHashMap
    factoryClassName: OV05
#    disable: true
- execute:
    id: XE12
    module:
      namespace: org.otc
    source:
      objectPath: travelerDetailType.name.surname
    target:
      objectPath: dataLists.passengerList.passenger[*].identityDocuments[*].visa
    factoryClassName: XE12
#    disable: true</pre>
					<br/>
				</li>
				<li><b>"Flip OTCS" button:</b> This button flips the parameters of the <b>"from:"</b> and the <b>"to:"</b> 
					in each of the OTCS command blocks. Most often there will be a need to create a reverse-mapping of the
					OTCS contents you already created. Clicking this button will do that job. However, one point to note is, 
					in some scenarios due to the kind of properties supported within the parameters of the <b>"from:"</b> 
					and the <b>"to:"</b>, there may be some minor information that will be lost in certain scenarios in 
					specific OTCS-command-blocks, which has to be fixed manually.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				</li>
				<li><b>"Clear" button:</b> This button deletes all the contents in the OTCS-area and resets the ID 
					generation internally.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				</li>
				<li><b>Tree-area:</b> This section at the bottom of the page has a <b>"source-tree"</b> and a 
					<b>"target-tree"</b> panels on either side where the tree-structures of both the source and target 
					classes are displayed. Expand both of them as appropriate to navigate to the required fields on both 
					sides and select them and then click on <b>"Add OTCS command"</b> to create the OTCS command block.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				</li>
				<li><b>Pop-up Context-menus:</b> There are a couple of context-menus that will pop up when certain nodes on 
					the tree are right-clicked -
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Right-clicking on the root-node of either tree pops-up a menu with some override-options as shown. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					When any collection type node on the target tree such as an array or a list or a set or a dictionary is 
					right clicked, an option to set or unset an <b>Anchor</b> is shown. The "Anchoring" feature is discussed 
					in detail in section on <b>"Anchors"</b>.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Structure of OTCS.</h4>
			The OTC script which you see above are created in the YAML format which looks similar to JSON. A basic 
			knowledge of working with YAML is recommended to work with OTCS. There are several tutorial websites as 
			well as YouTube videos on YAML which can help you familiarize yourself in approximately 10 minutes.
			<br />
			<br />
			A OTCS file has 2 main sections called the <b>"metadata:"</b> and <b>"commands:"</b>.
			<br />
			<br />
			<ol>
				<li><b>The "metadata:" section:</b>
					This section contains the mandatory parameters such as the object-types and the entry-class name, 
					and an optional parameter called the helper.
					<ol type="a">
						<li>The <b>"source:"</b> and <b>"target:"</b> types in the <b>"metadata:"</b> section are auto 
							populated by the tool with the selections done on the <b>"Types"</b> drop-downs on the UI while 
							creating the first OTCS block.
						</li>
						<li>The <b>"entryClassName:"</b> parameter is the class-name for which the value is auto populated 
							which the developer may change if required. When the compiler generates code, it creates an 
							entry-class with this name.</li>
						<li>The optional <b>"helper:"</b> parameter is used to specify the helper-class. The details on this 
							helper is covered on a section titled <b>"Overrides"</b>.</li>
					</ol>
					<br/>
				</li>
				<li><b>The "commands:" section:</b>
					This is the section which has all the OTCS command-blocks.
					<ol type="a">
						<li>A OTCS-command-block consists of either the <b>"copy:"</b> or the <b>"execute:"</b> command 
							with all its relevant parameters. These commands are covered in detail in other sections as we 
							progress.
						</li>
						<li>Each command has an ID parameter which is a unique ID assigned to each OTCS block. This ID is 
							auto-generated, but you can change it if you like ensuring it is unique.
						</li>
						<li>The <b>"copy"</b> command has a <b>"from:"</b> parameter which has either a <b>"values:"</b> 
							property with values defined to populate the created object fields or the <b>"objectPath:"</b> 
							property to create an object by reading values from a source object. The next section covers 
							this aspect in more detail.
						</li>
						<li>It also has a <b>"to:"</b> parameter which has a reference to the objectPath in the target 
							object.
						</li>
						<li>Each block has a mandatory <b>"factoryClassName:"</b> parameter which is auto-populated with the 
							same value as the auto-generated ID value. The developer may choose to change it if required with 
							a unique class-name for the source code file that will be generated for that block. The compiler 
							generates factory-classes one for each OTCS-command-block. The main entry-class calls each of 
							these generated factory-classes in the same order as the defined order of the OTCS blocks.
						</li>
						<li>Each block may also have an optional <b>"overrides:"</b> parameter. This parameter is covered in 
							detail on a later section titled <b>"Overrides"</b>.
						</li>
						<li>The <b>"execute:"</b> command has a different set of parameters and is covered in detail in a 
							separate section.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<br />
			<h4><u>Try it out:</u></h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Start the editor UI as indicated in the previous section's "Try it out:" heading.</li>
				<li>Enter the package name of the root source object as <b>"com.kronos.airlines.dto"</b> in the text box 
					labeled <b>"Pkg/NS"</b> on the "From / Source" section (left side)</li>
				<li>Enter the package name of the root target object as <b>"com.athena.airlines.dto"</b> in the text box 
					labeled <b>"Pkg/NS"</b> of the "To / Target" section (right side)</li>
				<li>And then click on the <b>"Fetch types"</b> button. You will notice the <b>"Types"</b> drop-down is 
					populated with all the types in the <b>"com.kronos.airlines.dto"</b> package.
				</li>
				<li>Select the root source type from the drop-down dialog box.</li>
				<li>Repeat the same actions for the target-type on the right panel.</li>
				<li>If you want to create OTCS commands by only providing values without using a source object, 
					then there is no need to select a source-type and only the target-type details will suffice.</li>
				<li>After entering the required details click on the <b>"Show Tree"</b> button.</li>
				<li>The tree structure of the selected classes will be displayed in the below tree-area.</li>
				<li>Next expand the trees on both sides and select the required fields.</li>
				<li>Then click on the <b>"Add OTCS Command"</b> button.</li>
				<li>You will notice the script begins with the <b>"metadata:"</b> section in the <b>"OTCS-script-area"</b> 
					followed by the copy OTCS command block.
				</li>
				<li>Repeat this step until all the required OTCS command blocks are added.</li>
				<li>You can right-click on the root node to display the context menu with few <b>"Overrides"</b> options.</li>
				<li>Overrides can be flagged only at the root level on the tree which gets applied to the whole tree.</li>
				<li>You may select or de-select the options under <b>"Overrides"</b> based on need.</li>
				<li>You can use the handler on the right bottom of the "script-area" to resize the view as needed.</li>
				<li>Select an Override option and then add a OTCS command-block. You will notice the "Overrides" parameters 
					are added in the newly added script-block.
				</li>
				<li>Now turn off the Override and try adding another OTCS command to see the difference.</li>
				<li>Another context-menu is the <b>"Anchoring"</b> menu. You can apply the anchor flag on any 
					collection-type such as the array, a list, a set or a dictionary type. 
				</li>
				<li>Right-click on one of the collection-type fields and enable the Anchor. Now add a command-block. 
					You will see the Anchor applied on a collection type token in the newly created command-block.</li>
				<li>Continue playing around with different permutations and combinations until you become comfortable.</li>
				<li>Click on <b>"Create file"</b> button. You will get a message drawing your attention that some 
					place-holders in some sections are not updated.</li>
				<li>Remove the <b>"helper:"</b> parameter under the <b>"metadata:"</b> section for now.
				</li>
				<li>You will notice that the "IDs are auto-generated and are in unique-sequence. The <b>"id:"</b> is a 
					mandatory parameter.
				</li>
				<li>Make sure the script does not contain any placeholder.</li>
				<li>And then click on the <b>"Create File"</b> button.</li>
				<li>The <b>".otcs"</b> file will be downloaded.</li>
				<li>Go to your downloads folder and copy the OTCS file to the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-pretest"</b> folder.</li>
