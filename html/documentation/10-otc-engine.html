	<h3>Section 10: OTC Engine</h3>
	<p>
		In this section, we will look at the various components in the OTC Engine.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The OTC engine is the execution environment for your OTCS files. It consists of the below components -
		<ol>
			<li>OTCS Compiler, </li>
			<li>Source-code generator, </li>
			<li>Source-code compiler, </li>
			<li>Token Metadata (TMD) registry, </li>
			<li>Indexer, and </li>
			<li>Executor.</li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
		There are 4 steps in all and all 4 has to be invoked on a <b>DEV-cum-unittest</b> box. However, while promoting to 
		other environments such as the QA or PROD, only the last step has to be invoked. The 4 steps are -
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<ol>
			<li>OTCS compilation, </li>
			<li>Source-code compilation, </li>
			<li>TMD registration, </li>
			<li>Execution</li>
		</ol>
		<br/>
		<ol>
			<li><b><u>Step One : Compile OTCS files</u></b>
			    <br/>
				The first phase is to compile the OTCS files. The OTC Script compiler has 5 sub-components which are the 
				typical components in any compiler -
				<ul>
					<li>The Lexicalizer, </li>
					<li>The Syntax checker, </li>
					<li>The Semantics checker</li>
					<li>The Token metadata (TMD) generator - akin to intermediate code generator</li>
					<li>The Source Code Generator.</li>
				</ul>
			    <br/>
				The TMD files are created in this step and are used during source-code generation and during execution step. 
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
				During source-code generation, there are several sub-components that kicks in to generate object-conversion 
				source-code. As already mentioned the generated source-code are placed in the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/src"</b> folder.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    Please go through the <b>"org.otcframework.test.unit.OtcTest.java"</b> class to get the whole picture.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
				To compile the OTCS files, do the following –
			    <pre>OtcsCompiler otcsCompiler = OtcsCompilerImpl.getInstance();
otcsCompiler.compile(); </pre>
			    <br/>
				As already mentioned the OTC-Compiler will look for the <b>"*.otcs"</b> files under 
				<b>"${OTC_HOME}/unittest"</b> folder	
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
		    </li>
			<li><b><u>Step Two : Source-code Compilation</u></b>
			    <br/>
				This step is invoked separately. This gives an opportunity to the developer to review and tweak the 
				generated source code to do any additional processing if required before compiling it.
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
				To compile the source code –
				<pre>OtcsCompiler otcsCompiler = OtcsCompilerImpl.getInstance();
otcsCompiler.compileSourceCode(); </pre>
			    <br/>
			</li>
			<li><b><u>Step Three : TMD Registration</u></b>
			    <br/>
				This TMD-Registration step is automatically invoked by the OTC-Executor upon initialization and hence is not 
				required to be explicitly invoked on other environments such as QA and PROD. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				TMD is part of the OTC's internals and so going into the details of the TMD is not required.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				However, you should make note that if the OTCS compilation and source-code compilation is explicitly invoked 
				which will happen only on a <b>DEV-cum-unittest</b> box, the TMD registration also has be invoked explicitly 
				in order to tell the OTC-Executor to register the newly created TMDs in the TMD container. On OTC Engine 
				start-up, if the TMD loader finds any TMD files in the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/tmd"</b> folder and the matching 
				compiled object-conversion executables in the class-path, it will load them automatically. And that would 
				mean that once the generated source-code are integrated into your project, there is no need to invoke this as 
				a separate step. If there is a mismatch in the TMD files and the compiled executable such as missing compiled 
				object-conversion code, the registration will fail. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b><i><u>Note:</u></b> The "*.tmd" files has to be copied from the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/tmd"</b> folder on your 
				<b>DEV-cum-unittest</b> box to other environments such as QA and PROD. </i>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Invoking the TMD registry –
				<br/>
				<pre>OtcRegistry otcRegistry = OtcRegistryImpl.instance;
otcRegistry.register(); </pre>
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li><b><u>Step Four : The Executor</u></b>
				<br/>
				In this step, the Executor internally will first try to retrieve the registered TMD set. If it finds them, 
				it will invoke the <b>'Indexer'</b> sub-component passing on the TMD set and the source object if applicable. 
				The <b>'Indexer'</b> indexes all the collections if present (i.e both lists and maps). After the Indexer 
				completes, the Executor finally invokes the compiled executable. After integrations, on other environments 
				such as the QA and PROD, this is the only step you will have to invoke every time you want to perform an 
				object-conversion.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				There are 2 methods with different method signatures to invoke the executor. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				If the OTCS file consists of values only, (meaning there is no source object used) and so the parameters 
				would 
				be only 3 as shown below -
				<br/>
				<pre><i>Method signature:</i> 
	execute(String namespace, Class&lt;T&gt; targetClz, Map&lt;String, Object&gt; data)

<i>Ex:-</i>
	OtcExecutor otcExecutor = OtcExecutorImpl.getInstance();
	otcExecutor.execute("com.example", Passenger.class, null); </pre>
				<br/>
				If the OTCS file uses a source-object (copy-values command inclusive) then the format is as given in the 
				below example -
				<br/>
				<pre><i>Method signature:</i>
	execute(String namespace, S source-object, Class&lt;T&gt; targetClz, Map&lt;String, Object&gt; data);

<i>Ex:-</i>
	OtcExecutor otcExecutor = OtcExecutorImpl.getInstance();
	otcExecutor.execute(null, employee-object, Passenger.class, data); </pre>
				<br/>
				Please note that <b>'null'</b> can be passed for the first and the last parameters which are the package-name 
				and the Map parameters.
