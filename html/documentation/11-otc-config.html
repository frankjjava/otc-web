		<h3>Section 11: OTC Configuration</h3>
		
		In this section, we will look at configuring the OTC Engine.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		We already got familiar with <b>"${OTC_HOME}"</b> folder in the 'Getting Started' section. 
		But now lets look at the folder structure in detail -
		<br/>

		<br/>
		<br/>
		<ol>
			<li><b>The "config" folder:</b>
			<br/>
			This is the folder where the configuration files are stored. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				There are two configuration files "otc.properties" and "log.properties" which we need to be concerned about. 
				These property files consist of the OTC engine configurations and logging configurations. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li><u>The "otc.properties" file:</u>
						<br/>
						<br/>
						The OTC configurations are kept in this file. Both the OTCS editor and the OTC Engine loads the 
						configuration defined in this file. It has only one property which we should be concerned about and 
						that is - 
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<pre>executor.packages.filter= --enter package-names --</pre>
						<br/>
						Your DTO classes will belong to a package. Its members may consist of classes 
						from other libraries and belonging to other packages. But you may want to filter 
						classes of only some desired packages. For example, in the Editor you may want to 
						filter only the classes of specific packages in the source-tree and the target-tree. 
						In such a case you may set this property appropriately. For multiple packages, put 
						them in separate lines as shown here –
						<br/>
						<pre>executor.packages.filter=com.athena.airlines.dto \
            com.kronos.airlines.dto</pre>
						<br/>
					</li>
					<li><u>The "log.properties" file:</u>
						<br/>
						The logging configurations are kept in the <b>log.properties</b> file which are used in the 
						<b>"logback-included.xml"</b> file present in the same folder. Please take a look at these 
						files for logging configurations. 
					</li>
				</ul>
			<br/>
			</li>
			<li><b>The "lib" folder:</b>
				<br/>
				This folder is the location where the jar files containing the DTO classes are stored 
				which are used by the OTCS editor.
				<br/>
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li><b>The "logs" folder:</b>
				<br/>
				This folder is the location where the the Editor and the Engine stores application logs.
				<br/>
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li><b>The "otc-pretest" folder:</b>
				<br/>
				This folder is used as a store for all <b>"*.otcs"</b> OTCS files meant for unit-testing. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li><b>The "otc-unittest" folder:</b>
				<br/>
				This folder is where the OTCS Compiler looks for the OTCS files when the "compile()" method on the compiler 
				is invoked. When you want to test multiple OTCS files, test them one by one 
				by copying them from the "pretest" folder to this folder.  A directory structure under this folder is 
				translated to a package-name in the generated source code files. For example, a folder structure such as 
				"org/otcl" as shown here will create the generated source code under the package "org.otcl". 
				<br/>
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li><b>The "otc-pretest" folder:</b>
				<br/>
				This folder is where the already tested OTCS files are kept. After testing the OTCS files, move them to 
				this folder in order to avoid repeat compilations of the already tested OTCS files on every test iteration.   
				<br/>
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li><b>The "src" folder:</b>
				<br/>
				This folder is the location where the compiler stores the generated source code files.    
				<br/>
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li><b>The "target" folder:</b>
				<br/>
				This folder is the location where the compiler stores the compiled class files.   
				<br/>
				<br/>
			</li>
			<li><b>The "test-samples" folder:</b>
				<br/>
				This folder consist of the <b>Kronos-passenger-map.xml</b> file used to build an object of 
				<b>KronosAirlinePassenger</b> which is used as the source object in this course.  
				<br/>
				<br/>
