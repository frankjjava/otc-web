		<h3>Section 3: The Test project</h3>
		In the previous sections we have learnt about creating the OTCS files. In this section, we will learn how to use the 
		downloaded test-project to execute those OTCS files, generate the object-conversion source code and execute them.
		The <b>"Getting Started"</b> section covered details on setting up the <b>"Test project"</b> available in the 
		download.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h4>The test classes and sample classes:</h4> 
		There are a few test classes with each of them having a different focus and a couple of example classes -
		<ol type="a">
			<li>The most important one is the <b>"org.otcframework.test.unit.OtcTest.java"</b> which is the main Junit-test 
				class used for Unit testing. You should use this class to compile the OTCS files and generate all your 
				required object-conversion code after updating the test method appropriately.
			</li>
			<li>The <b>"org.otcframework.test.benchmark.otc.JmhTest.java"</b> class tests OTCS's performance.</li>
			<li>The <b>"org.otcframework.test.benchmark.mapstruct.JmhTest.java"</b> tests the Mapstruct framework's 
				performance.
			</li>
			<li>There are a few example classes from the <b>"otc-test-schema"</b> project used in the test-case OTCS 
				files.</li>
			<li>One of them is the <b>"otcframework.test.converter.TestConverter.java"</b> used as an example for use while 
				testing OTCS's <b>"execute"</b> command.
			</li>
			<li>The other one is the <b>"otcframework.test.helper.TestFactoryHelper.java"</b> in the  package used as an
				example while trying out test cases on <b>"Overrides"</b>.</li>
			<li>The <b>"com.kronos.airlines.dto.KronosAirlinePassenger"</b> and the 
				<b>com.athena.airlines.dto.AthenaAirlinePassenger</b> and their child classes which are used as source and 
				target types in the test cases.</li>
			<li>All these classes are annotated with JAXB annotations only for the purpose of generating XML output for 
				demonstration purposes and to validate them with the test cases. This has got nothing to do with the OTC 
				framework.</li>
		</ol>
		<br />

		<h4>Unit Test class:</h4>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>The <b>"org.otcframework.test.unit.OtcTest"</b> Junit-test class has a test method which first calls 
				the <b>"compileAndDeploy()"</b> method.
			</li>
			<li>This method first calls the <b>"compile()"</b> method on the OTCS-Compiler to compile the OTCS files.</li>
			<li>When the <b>"compile()"</b> method is called, the OTCS-compiler scans the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otcs-unittest/"</b> 
				folder and sub-folders, compiles all the <b>"*.otcs"</b> files and generates the source-code.
			</li>
			<li>The test class then calls the <b>"compileSourceCode()"</b> method on the compiler to compile the generated 
				source code.
			</li>
			<li>Once the <b>"compile()"</b> method executes successfully, you will notice the generated source code files 
				are placed in the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/src"</b> folder.
			</li>
			<li>Once compiled, the <b>".class"</b> files are placed in the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/target"</b> folder.</li>
			<li>Next it calls the <b>"register()"</b> method to register some metadata files generated for internal use by 
				the engine.
			</li>
			<li>As already mentioned you will not be required to call all the above method in your project after 
				integration. Once integrated, you will have to call only the <b>"otcExecutor.execute(...)"</b> method from 
				within your project.
			</li>
			<li>Finally the test class calls the <b>"execute()"</b> method passing the required parameters.</li>
			<li>After the conversion, the test class invokes the JAXB's marshaler to generate the output in XML format.</li>
		</ol>
		<br />

		<h4>OTCS Files:</h4>
		A few points about the OTCS files used as test cases in the sections. There are 41 test-case scenarios in the OTCS 
		files situated in the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-pretest"</b>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>OTCS object-path mapping combinations of source and target in the sections were created to cover as many 
				test scenarios as possible.
			</li>
			<li>So, sanity of the mappings does not deserve a focus. So please focus on the mapping combinations scenarios 
				only in the test cases and not on the sanity of the mappings.</li>
			<li>The <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-pretest"</b> folder is like only a store for all the OTCS files.</li>
			<li>Whenever you want to unit-test a specific OTCS file, copy the file or the folder containing the OTCS file 
				to <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-unittest"</b> folder.</li>
			<li>Once a OTCS file is unit-tested, move them to the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-tested"</b> folder. The reason we are 
				moving them out after testing is to avoid repeated compilation of the already tested OTCS files on every 
				test iteration.</li>
		</ol>
		<br />

		<h4>Package structure:</h4>
		To have the OTC framework generate the source code files to belong to any package structure, create the folder
		structure accordingly matching the package structure you desire.
		<br/>
		<br/>

		<h4>The DTOs:</h4> 
		JAXB objects created from WSDL/XSD are used as data-objects in the test cases. So here are some points on the DTOs 
		used for testing.
		<ol type="a">
			<li>The downloaded file contains a Maven project named <b>"otcs-test-schema"</b> which contains the DTOs 
				referred to in all our examples and test-cases in these tutorials. The test-project has a dependency on this 
				schema project. Import this project into your IDE and build it. Refer to these DTOs for a better 
				understanding while doing the exercises. 
			</li>
			<li>The compiled <b>".jar"</b> file with these DTOs are placed in <b>"${OTC_HOME}/lib"</b> folder.</li>
			<li>It is created from a schema related to airline travel domain.</li>
			<li>The schema contains all the required classes representing 2 different mock airlines named Kronos airlines 
				and Athena airlines.</li>
			<li>The DTOs are annotated with JAXB components for the purpose of generating the XML output in the examples to 
				help in demonstration only. But, the OTC Framework does not have any requirements for any such annotations.
			</li>
			<li>The original DTOs were updated with a few additional fields repeated in a few classes with the objective to 
				cater to the different test scenarios only. So kindly ignore the sanity of such updates.
			</li>
			<li>To run tests with data-objects related to your project, package them into a <b>".jar"</b> file and copy it 
				to the <b>:"${OTC_HOME}/lib"</b> folder. You need to do this because the OTCS-Editor looks for them in this 
				folder location.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<br />

		<h4>Source Object XML:</h4> 
		Here is some information about the source object used in all the examples -
		<ol type="a">
			<li>The <b>"${OTC_HOME}/test-samples/Kronos-passenger-map.xml"</b> has the test-data.</li>
			<li>The object KronosAirlinePassenger which is used as the source object in the majority of the test cases is 
				created from this file.
			</li>
			<li>Having an understanding of this XML will help you to compare and analyze the output generated by the 
				test-cases in the sections.
			</li>
			<li>While executing the examples given in the sections, please refer to this file to compare with the generated 
				output.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<br />

		<h4>Additional info:</h4> 
		Below are some additional important information. 
		<ol type="a">
			<li>The last method parameter.
				<ol type="i">
					<li>All classes implementing the above interfaces and all OTCS generated classes takes a java.util.Map 
						as the last method parameter.</li>
					<li>When will you need this ? – when you are integrating OTC in your software project, let us say you 
						already have another object before invoking the executor's execute method. You want to make this 
						object available in the generated classes which you may want to modify and do some additional 
						processing, or, make the object available in a custom converter that you write, then you may put 
						such data in the map and then call the <b>"execute"</b> method on the Executor passing this map as 
						the last parameter. 
						<br/>
						Now, that such objects/data are available in the OTCS generated classes or the custom converter 
						which you write, you may retrieve them and use it for whatever processing you may want to do.</li>
					<li>Note: Never add state (instance level objects) to the generated source code and use them as using 
						them in the code may cause undesired results. Instead you can choose this option of passing the 
						values in the map.</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>There are 2 interfaces which you should know.
				<ol type="i">
					<li>The OTCS generated entry-class implements the <b>"org.otcframework.common.executor.CodeExecutor"</b> 
						interface.
					</li>
					<li>Any custom converter you write should implement the 
						<b>"org.otcframework.common.converter.OtcConverter"</b> interface.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
			</li>
		</ol>
		<i><b><u>Note:</u></b> After unit testing, if you happen to delete the generated source files, you will also have to 
			delete the .tmd files from the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/tmd"</b> folder.</i>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<h4>Try it out:</h4>
			In this exercise we will learn to unit test the OTCS files which are provided in 
			<b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-pretest"</b> folder and referred to in the various sections.
		<ol>
			<li>Start your file-manager and copy the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-pretest/cpyvalues1"</b> folder to 
				<b>""${OTC_HOME}/otc-unittest"</b> folder.</li>
			<li>The <b>"cpyvalues1"</b> has a file named <b>"com.athena.airlines.dto.AthenaAirlinePassenger.otcs"</b>.</li>
			<li>Open the <b>"OtcTest.java"</b> class.</li>
			<li>In the <b>"runTest()"</b> method locate the line <b>"otcsCommandType = ...."</b>.</li>
			<li>Ensure it is initialized to <b>"OTCS_COMMAND_TYPE.FROM_VALUES"</b> as in <b>"otcsCommandType = 
				OTCS_COMMAND_TYPE.FROM_VALUES;"</b>.</li>
			<li>The call to the appropriate <b>"execute(...)"</b> method is based on a condition which you can see in the 
				code where it checks for the value of <b>"otcsCommandType"</b>.</li>
			<li>Next set the package-name variable ("pkg") appropriately. If the OTCS file does not belong to any package 
				then set this value to <b>"null";</b></li>
			<li>Locate the line <b>"pkg = ..."</b>.</li>
			<li>Initialize it to <b>'pkg = "cpyvalues1";'</b> - this is the package name (folder which you just copied).</li>
			<li>There are 2 different versions of the execute methods with varying parameters where one does not take 
				a source object while the other does.</li>
			<li>Run the Junit test class - in your IDE right click anywhere on your OtcTest.java class which you have
				opened and select <b>"Run As Junit"</b> option.</li>
			<li>The test method compiles the <b>"*.otcs"</b> file, generates and compiles the source-code, executes it
				and marshals the created target object AthenaAirlinePassenger to XML and prints it on the console.</li>
			<li>After the <b>"runTest()"</b> completes successfully, you may want to review the generated object conversion
				source code.</li>
			<li>Navigate to <b>"$ <b>"${OTC_HOME}/src"</b> folder and you should be able to see the generated source-code 
				files.
			</li>
			<li>Next try out the same steps for another test case.</li>
			<li>First delete the <b>"/cpyvalues1"</b> fold"</b>  under <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-unittest"</b> - we do not want 
				the OTC compiler to unnecessarily spend time compiling a <b>".otcs"</b> file and generate source code once 
				again for which we don't have to any longer.</li>
			<li>This time copy the <b>"${OTC_HOME}/otc-pretest/cpysource_mixedpath"</b> .</li>
			<li>Remember to change 'otcsCommandType = OTCS_COMMAND_TYPE.FROM_SOURCE_OBJECT;' and 
				<b>'pkg = "cpysource_mixedpath;"'</b>.</li>
